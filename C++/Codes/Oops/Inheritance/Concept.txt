In C++, inheritance allows a derived class to inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. The type of inheritance (public, private, or protected) determines the accessibility of the inherited members in the derived class.

Multiple Inheritance : A derived class which is derived from more than one base class i.e., a class can inherit from two or more classes is known as multiple inheritance.


Multilevel Inhertance: When a chain to Inheritance is done in a increasing precedence order, the sort of inheritance is refferred to as Multilevel Inheritance.

Hybrid Inheritance : When there is Multiple as well as Multilevel inheritance , combined together it is refferred to as Hybrid Inheritance.


                        class A 
                           |
                -------------------------
                |                       |
            class B                   class c
                |                       |
                -------------------------
                            |
                         class D (Case of Ambiguity is generated here)

NOTE : In order to solve the Ambiguity factor, we can use scope resolution operator or Inherit the class virtually.



Syntax:

class a{

};

class b : public a{

};

-RTTI

RTTI (Runtime Type Information) is a mechanism in C++ that provides information about an object's data type at runtime. This information is 
typically stored as part of an object's class hierarchy, and it allows programs to determine the type of an object even if the type of the 
object is not known at compile-time. RTTI enables a number of important programming techniques, including dynamic dispatch, dynamic casting,
and reflection.RTTI was added to the C++ language because many vendors of class libraries were implementing this functionality themselves. 
This caused incompatibilities between libraries. Thus, it became obvious that support for run-time type information was needed at the language 
level.


For the sake of clarity, this discussion of RTTI is almost completely restricted to pointers. However, the concepts discussed also apply 
to references.

There are three main C++ language elements to run-time type information:
•   The dynamic_cast operator - Used for conversion of polymorphic types. (ptr twc = dynamic_cast<ptr twc>(ptr tbc))
•   The typeid operator -  Used for identifying the exact type of an object.(typeid(*ptr).name())(typeinfo header should be included)
•   The type_info class -  Used to hold the type information returned by the typeid operator.

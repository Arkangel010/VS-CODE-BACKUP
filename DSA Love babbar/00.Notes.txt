Psedocode - Lemann terms use and explain a problem.Genric way of representing alorithm in textual form.  

Flowchart - Graphical Representation of the working of an algorithm.

Note: Algorithm ki ladai hai coding ki nhi, coding koi bhi kar lega.

Flowchart components:

(i) Terminator - Elliptical box in which we show the start and end the program.

(ii) Input/Output Block - It is a parallelogram shaped box used to represent input and output.

(iii) Process Block - It is a rectangle shaped box used to represent proccessing / intialization phase of the program.

(iv) Decision making block - It is a vertical diamond/Rhombus shaped box which is used to represent the conditional phase of the program.

(v) Arrow - As shape of its name used to represet the flow the program.

(vi) Connector - It is circle shaped box used to represent a function.
